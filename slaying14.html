            <h3>Fruits</h3>
            <p id="fruitspara">In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering.In common language usage, fruit normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries.</p>

            <h3>Walking</h3>
            <p id="walkingspara">Walking (also known as ambulation) is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals. Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits. Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the usable number of limbsâ€”even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk.</p>
